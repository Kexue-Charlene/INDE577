# Perceptron

In this file, we will apply perceptron. The dataset is from sklearn called make_blobs. It has 150 samples and 2 features.Our goal is to classify the two groups.
In the end, we will draw a decision boundary to split two groups. 

The perceptron algorithm was inspired by neurons which is the  basic processing units in the brain. 
Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks. 
Perceptron, a supervised learning, is a binary linear classifier. It helps to classify the given input data. 

The perceptron includes 4 parts:
* Input values or one input layer
* Weights and Bias
* Net sum
* Activation Function
