# Supervised Learning

Supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement Machine Learning basically are a description of ways in which you can let machines or algorithms loose on a data set.
Supervised learning is where you have input variables and an output variable 
and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
The goal is to approximate the mapping function that when new input data coming that you can predict the output variables for that data.
We can image the teacher supervise the learning process. The same thing happened to supervised learning.

In this file, I will introduce many different supervised learning algorithms:
* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets-Multilayer Perceptron
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning
* Perceptron
