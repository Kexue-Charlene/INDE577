# Ensemble machine learning

In the world of machine learning, it is full of different levels of algorithms. However, when applying these algorithms, something is missing with data due to it being bias or variance or noise in data. We are able to find the variance or loss in the result, but unable to find a good accuracy. We can use ensemble machine learning to deal with these problems. 

Ensemble learning combines several tree base algorithms which construct a better predictive performance than a single tree base algorithm. The main principle of ensemble model is that several weak learners combined together to form a strong learner resulting in an increasing accuracy model.

# Ensemble learning Types
Ensemble algorithems is divided into three main categoty:
* Bagging
* Boosting
* Stacking 
For each of them, they have different way to use. The details list below:

# Random forest 
Random forest classifier is an ensemble tree-based learning algorithm. It is a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. The votes were aggregated from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.
