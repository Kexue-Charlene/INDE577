# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary. The logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables. 

A logistic regression produces a logistic curve which is limited to between 0 and 1. Logistic regression is kind of the same as a linear regression, but the curve is constructed using the natural logarithm of odds of the target variable instead of probability. 

In this file, we apply logistic regression. This dataset is about the health care-heart attack poosibility. We defined some functions Sigmoid function, log loss function, decision boundary function. 
In the end, we printed out the precision, recall, f1-score and support value.
