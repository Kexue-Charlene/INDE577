# INDE577

INDE 577 is a data science and machine learning course. This course covers supervised and unsupervised algorithms. 

Supervised learning including:

* Linear Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Nets-Multilayer Perceptron
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision/ Regression Trees
* Ensemble Learning
* Perceptron

Unsupervised learning including:
* K means Clustering
* Priciple component analysis 

In this project, we code these algorithms from scrach by using python in jupyter notebook. For the data we use are different from each algorithms. Some of them are from kaggle, and some of them are from sklearn dataset. More details can be found in each file.
