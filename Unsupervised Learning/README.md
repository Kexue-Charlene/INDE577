# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uses to identify patterns in neither classified nor unlabeled data sets. Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach 
in which models do not have any supervisor to guide them. We can image that 
student solves problems without a teacher's supervision. 


## Types of unsupervised learning algorithms
There are many types of unsupervised learning algorithms:
* K-means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Anomaly Detection
* Apriori Algorithm 

We will combine PCA and K-means Clustering together in this file. The dataset is from Kaggle. More details can be found in the file.
